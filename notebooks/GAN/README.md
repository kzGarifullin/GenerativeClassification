## Source and Inspiration

The code for these laptops was sourced from the [StyleGAN2 PyTorch repository](https://github.com/karray/stylegan2-pytorch/tree/master) and influenced by the article ["Self-Supervised Representation Learning Using StyleGAN"](https://medium.com/@karray/self-supervised-representation-learning-using-stylegan-11937c0a2ad0).

## Requirements

To execute the laptops, you will need:
- All files from the 'op' folder of the repository
- `distributed_utils.py` (renamed from `distributed.py` to avoid import conflicts)
- `model.py`
- `non_leaking.py`
- `smallnet.py`

These files are downloaded automatically by the script. If you encounter any issues, you can manually copy the files.
